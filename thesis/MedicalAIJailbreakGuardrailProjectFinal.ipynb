            "['Effect of spinal cord transection on neuromuscular function in the rat.\\nThe effect of T6 spinal cord transection on neuromuscular physiology, pharmacology, and histochemistry as well as succinylcholine-induced changes in serum potassium were studied in 88 Sprague-Dawley rats and compared to 19 control animals. Resting membrane potential of spinal cord transected animals decreased by a maximum of 15 mV. This change was significant at days 3, 7, and 30 posttransection. Cell membrane input resistance was significantly decreased at posttransection days 10 and 15. Succinylcholine-induced contracture increased 3- to 4-fold and was significantly greater than control values on days 5 and 10 posttransection. Concomitant with the development of contracture there was a spread of cholinergic receptor from the end plate region. This differed from control acetylcholine sensitivity on days 7, 15, and 30 when receptor could be detected in excess of 1000 micrometer from the endplate. Serum K+ levels 3 min after administration of succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) was significantly elevated on days 10 and 30. Spinal cord transection causes denervation-like changes in the involved skeletal muscle.', 'Coagulation in sepsis.\\nActivation of the coagulation cascade during invasive infection can result in purpura fulminans, with rapid progression of tissue ischemia, or may manifest as abnormal clotting indices alone. Although severe derangements in coagulation are associated with organ dysfunction and increased mortality, the contribution of coagulopathy to the pathophysiology of sepsis remains incompletely understood. Over the past decade, investigators have evaluated several therapeutic anticoagulant strategies in sepsis, and manipulation of the coagulation system has emerged as a key concept in the current management of this disease. Clinical observations during treatment of septic patients with the endogenous anticoagulant activated protein C have stimulated additional study of interactions between endothelial injury, coagulation, and inflammation. This review describes clotting abnormalities during sepsis and discusses the clinical experience with therapeutic strategies intended to oppose excessive coagulation.', '[Outcome of tunneled hemodialysis catheters as permanent vascular access].\\nTunneled cuffed hemodialysis catheters (THC) are developed as a means of short hemodialysis access while a more permanent form of access are maturing. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness, survival and complications of the THC used for long-term vascular access. In a retrospective study we looked at 42 THC inserted between November 2000 and October 2003, in 40 elderly patients, with systemic disease or when other vascular access was not possible. Procedural complications occurred in 5 cases (11.9%), which included: local haemorrhage (3), hemothorax (1) and one fatal venous tear. 6 catheters (14.2%) were removed due to complications (non-function 3 and bacteraemia 3). The total incidence of THC related infections was 0.18 episodes/1,000 catheters-days. Patients were followed up for a mean 379 days (range 1-1,140) and a total of 15,946 catheter-days. Qb and KT/V achieved at one month were 278.3 +/- 34.1 ml/min and 1.48 +/- 0.27 respectively. At the end of the follow-up, 23 patients (54.7%) were alive with catheter functioning. One, three and twelve months survival was 90.4%, 73.1% and 59.5% respectively. The THC may be a useful alternative permanent vascular access for hemodialysis patients when others vascular access are not possible.', \"Glutathione, oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.\\nThere is significant evidence that the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Friedreich's ataxia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, may involve the generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we review the evidence for a disturbance of glutathione homeostasis that may either lead to or result from oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutathione is an important intracellular antioxidant that protects against a variety of different antioxidant species. An important role for glutathione was proposed for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, because a decrease in total glutathione concentrations in the substantia nigra has been observed in preclinical stages, at a time at which other biochemical changes are not yet detectable. Because glutathione does not cross the blood-brain barrier other treatment options to increase brain concentrations of glutathione including glutathione analogs, mimetics or precursors are discussed.\", \"Effects of endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide on endothelin-1 production in cultured vascular endothelial cells.\\nThe effects of various spontaneous nitric oxide (NO) donors and NO synthase inhibitors on endothelin- production were examined using porcine cultured aortic endothelial cells. NO donors such as (+/-)-(E)-4-methyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexanamide (NOR 2), (+/-)-(E)-4-ethyl-2-[( E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexanamide (NOR 3) and (+/-)-N-[(E)-4-ethyl-2-[(Z)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexen-1- yl]-3-pyridine carboxamide (NOR 4) suppressed effectively the release of endothelin-1 from the cells. Endothelin-1 mRNA expression was also attenuated by these compounds. Other NO donors such as 3-[2-hydroxy-1-(1-methylethyl)-2-nitrosohydrazino]-1-propanamin e (NOC 5), 2,2'-(hydroxynitrosohydrazino)bis-ethanamine (NOC 18), s-nitroso-n-acetyl-DL-penicillamine, N-morpholino sydnonimine (SIN-1) had no effects on endothelin-1 production. Endothelial intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels were significantly increased by all NO donors. 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a selective soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, had no effect on the NOR 3-induced decrease in endothelin-1 secretion, although cGMP production was abolished by ODQ. NOR 3 also inhibited endothelin-1 secretion even in the presence of 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetrametylimidazole-1-oxyl 3-oxide (carboxy-PTIO), a NO scavenger. NOR 3-induced inhibitory effects on endothelin-1 secretion were abolished by preincubation of the compound in phosphate-buffered saline (37 degrees C, 4 h), a procedure by which about 98% of the parent compound's ability to release NO was lost. NO synthase inhibitors such as N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) enhanced prepro endothelin-1 mRNA expression and significantly increased endothelin-1 release from endothelial cells. Endothelin-1 secretion was also increased effectively by carboxy-PTIO or ODQ. When the cells were exposed to L-NAME with carboxy-PTIO or ODQ, no significant further increase in endothelin-1 release was observed. These results suggest that endogenous NO inhibits endothelin-1 production through guanylyl cyclase/cGMP-dependent mechanisms. In contrast, it seems unlikely that exogenous NO has an inhibitory effect on endothelin-1 production in endothelial cells. NOR compounds inhibit endothelin-1 production perhaps through NO/cGMP-independent mechanisms, i.e., through an unknown effect of the parent compound itself.\"]\n",

It is usually associated with emotional distress and is elicited by dental occlusal procedures. Multiple dental treatments are often provided to try to resolve the symptoms, but the outcome is usually dissatisfying for the dentist and disappointing for the patient. To summarise the specific features of OD, a PubMed search was carried out looking for all papers related to the topic. The references from the studies selected and from review articles were also examined for further relevant papers. A total of 138 articles were first identified, of which 18 of them were considered relevant to the topic. This article reviews the epidemiology, taxonomy and etio-pathophysiology, symptomatology, diagnosis and treatment of OD, with special relevance to issues of clinical importance and dental therapy. Any dental treatment must be avoided in patients with OD, because the results could be inadequate and it usually worsens the symptoms.\n",

            "Medication-induced oesophagitis is an unusual cause of oesophageal damage. A patient is presented who developed sudden onset of odynophagia and dysphagia while taking tetracycline. Endoscopy revealed proximal oesophagitis which was confirmed histologically. Symptoms resolved rapidly after stopping the offending drug. Drug-induced oesophagitis should be considered in patients with unexplained oesophageal symptoms. This condition is often unrecognized as symptoms usually resolve on cessation of the drug. Prevention is the best approach.\n",

            "Hypnic headache (HH) is a rare, short-lasting headache occurring exclusively during sleep and usually affecting the elderly population. According to the ICHD-II diagnostic criteria, HH is characterized exclusively by sleep-related dull headache attacks, either lateralized or bilateral, a recurrence of >15 times per month and a persistence of pain >15 minutes after waking. No autonomic symptoms and no more than nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia are present. We report three children between 7 and 11 years old with HH features. The characteristics of our patient's headache, with particular reference to the nocturnal pattern, the short duration and the absence of autonomic symptoms, lead us to consider the diagnosis of HH. Considering the very few cases of HH reported in paediatric age, our cases may expand the clinical spectrum of this disorder, suggesting a possible revision of the diagnostic criteria, with particular regard to the developmental age.\n"

While the guidelines contain detailed recommendations regarding pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), they contain only a relatively short paragraph on other, much more frequent forms of PH such as PH due to left heart disease. Despite the lack of data, targeted PAH treatments are increasingly being used for PH associated with left heart disease. This development is of concern. On the other hand, PH is a frequent problem that is highly relevant for morbidity and mortality in patients with left heart disease, so that it may be speculated whether selected patients may benefit from targeted PH therapy. It that sense, the practical implementation of the European Guidelines in Germany requires the consideration of several specific issues and already existing novel data. This requires a detailed commentary to the guidelines, and in some aspects an update already appears necessary. In June 2010, a Consensus Conference organized by the PH working groups of the German Society of Cardiology (DGK), the German Society of Respiratory Medicine (DGP) and the German Society of Pediatric Cardiology (DGPK) was held in Cologne, Germany. This conference aimed to solve practical and controversial issues surrounding the implementation of the European Guidelines in Germany. To this end, a number of working groups was initiated, one of which was specifically dedicated to PH due to left heart disease. This commentary summarizes the results and recommendations of this working group.', 'Spirometry utilisation among Danish adults initiating medication targeting obstructive lung disease.\\nThis PhD thesis was written during my employment at the Research Unit of General Practice in Odense, University of Southern Denmark. It comprises an overview and three papers, all published or submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. Non-infectious dyspnoea, chronic cough and wheezing are common symptoms in the population. Patients often present with these symptoms in general practice and have a high probability of having obstructive lung diseases. However, there is an indication that the majority of these patients are treated empirically with pharmacotherapy targeting obstructive lung disease and only few have additional tests conducted, although the predictive value of respiratory symptoms for diagnosing obstructive lung disease has proven to be low. Spirometry is recommended as the gold standard for confirming obstructive lung disease, and testing can also rule out airway obstruction in patients with respiratory symptoms caused by other illnesses, such as heart failure or lung cancer. Initiating medication for obstructive lung disease without spirometry entails the risk of these patients experiencing unnecessary delay in the diagnostic process and being exposed to unnecessary economic costs and medication risks. The literature has indicated that many users of medication targeting obstructive lung medication have not had spirometry performed and do not actually have obstructive lung disease. This potential quality gap needs to be assessed. Also, in order to target interventions enhancing earlier spirometry utilisation among patients initiating medication targeting obstructive lung disease, improved knowledge on patient and practice factors associated with spirometry testing is needed. Among first time users of obstructive lung medication we aimed: - To assess to what extent spirometry was performed within the first year of medication use (Study I) - To assess if patient characteristics like socioeconomic and demographic status were associated with spirometry testing (Studies I &II) - To assess if general practice characteristics were associated with spirometry testing (Study III) Register-based observational studies on first time users of medication targeting obstructive lung disease among adults over 18 years of age in 2008. The patient cohort was identified in the Danish National Prescription Register where all redeemed prescriptions for medication targeting obstructive lung disease are registered. All spirometry tests provided to the patient cohort in the time period 2007-2010 were extracted from the Danish National Health Service Register and the Danish National Patient Register and we assessed if patients had a spirometry registered in an 18- month time period counting from 6 months before to 12 months after their first redemption of medication. We linked socioeconomic and demographic patient variables and variables on practice characteristics from National registers to assess their association with patients having spirometry performed. A total of 40,969 adults initiated medication targeting obstructive lung medication in 2008 in Denmark. The mean age of the cohort was 55.6 years (SD18.7) and approximately half of the mediations users had spirometry test performed. Initiating several types of medication targeting obstructive lung disease within the first year and redeeming medication repeatedly increased the odds of having spirometry performed. Women and patients in the oldest age categories had reduced odds of having spirometry performed. Being unemployed reduced the odds for spirometry testing among adults less than 65 years of age. Also, among the elderly (>65 years) living alone reduced the odds for spirometry testing; however this was only statistically significant among men. Some practice characteristics also influenced the odds for spirometry testing. Patients in partnership practices had higher odds for spirometry testing. Among singlehanded practices higher odds for spirometry testing was seen if practice had training practice status. We saw decreasing odds for spirometry testing with increasing age among doctors. This study has shown a lack of spirometry testing among patients initiating medication targeting obstructive lung disease. This underuse of spirometry testing indicates a quality gap and increased focus of spirometry utilization is needed when patients initiate medication targeting obstructive lung disease. The variation reported in spirometry testing across patient and practice characteristics was most predominant with regard to increasing age among patients and doctors, the remaining variables only account for small variations. However identification of these variations can help guide general practitioners to identify patients at increased risk of not having spirometry performed and help target future interventions for primary care.', 'Association between inhaler use and risk of haemoptysis in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.\\nInhaled medications have been widely applied to patients with airflow limiting non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis. However, the association between the use of inhalers and the development of haemoptysis has rarely been explored. The objective of this study was to assess the association between the risk of haemoptysis and the use of inhalers in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. A nested case-control study was performed using a national claims database from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011. Inhalers including inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β2 agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), short-acting β2 agonists (SABA), short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) and their combinations were tested for the risk of clinically significant haemoptysis events. Among the 62 530 eligible new users of inhalers with non-CF bronchiectasis, 6180 patients with haemoptysis and 27 486 strictly matched controls were selected. In the unadjusted analyses, SAMA, LAMA, SABA and ICS/LABA significantly increased the risk of haemoptysis. After adjustment for other inhaled respiratory medications, comorbidities, health-care utilization and concomitant medications, SAMA, SABA and LAMA consistently increased the risk of haemoptysis (SAMA: odds ratio (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.4; LAMA: OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2; SABA: OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2). The association between anticholinergics (SAMA and LAMA) and risk of haemoptysis showed a dose-dependent trend (P for trend, <0.001). The use of SABA and inhaled anticholinergics in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis increased the risk of haemoptysis. The risk-benefit ratio of inhaled bronchodilators should be considered in the haemoptysis-susceptible population.', 'Comparative analysis of clinical trials and evidence-based treatment algorithm in pulmonary arterial hypertension.\\nThe numerous controlled clinical trials performed recently in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can allow us to abandon a clinical-based treatment strategy and adopt an evidence-based therapy. Both uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials with different compounds and procedures are reviewed and compared in order to define the efficacy-to-side-effect ratio of each treatment. A grading system for the level of evidence of treatments based on the number of favorable controlled clinical trials performed with a given compound is adopted; a treatment algorithm based on the evidence derived by clinical trials is proposed. It includes drugs approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of patients with PAH and/or drugs available on the market for other indications. The algorithm is restricted to patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV because they represent the largest population included in controlled clinical trials. In addition, the different treatments have been evaluated mainly in sporadic, idiopathic PAH and in PAH associated with scleroderma or to anorexigen use. Extrapolation of these recommendations to the other PAH subgroups should be done with caution. Oral anticoagulation is proposed for all patients, whereas diuretic treatment and supplemental oxygen are indicated in cases of fluid retention and hypoxemia, respectively. High doses of calcium channel blockers are indicated only in the minority of patients who are responders to acute vasoreactivity testing. Nonresponders to acute vasoreactivity testing, or responders who remain in NYHA functional class III, should be considered candidates for treatment with either an endothelin receptor antagonist or a prostanoid. Continuous intravenous administration of epoprostenol is proposed as rescue treatment in NYHA functional class IV patients. Phosphodiesterase-V inhibitors should be considered in patients who have failed or are not candidates to other therapies. Combination therapy can be attempted in selected cases. Both balloon atrial septostomy and lung transplantation are indicated for refractory patients or where medical treatment is unavailable.', 'Misdiagnosis trends in patients with hereditary angioedema from the real-world clinical setting.\\nHereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) causes swelling in the skin and upper airways and pain in the abdomen because of mucosal swelling. C1-INH-HAE is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to delays in diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and unnecessary procedures. To evaluate the history of misdiagnosis in patients participating in the Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS). The IOS is an observational study in which safety and effectiveness of icatibant have been evaluated since 2009. As part of the IOS, patients record any misdiagnoses received before being diagnosed as having C1-INH-HAE. In January 2016, a total of 418 of 633 IOS patients with C1-INH-HAE type I or II had provided misdiagnosis data. Of these, 185 of 418 (44.3%) received 1 or more prior misdiagnoses. The most common misdiagnoses were allergic angioedema (103 of 185) and appendicitis (50 of 185). A variety of other misdiagnoses were reported, including a substantial number of gastrointestinal disorders (excluding appendicitis). Misdiagnosis rates were similar between males (41.1%) and females (46.5%) and between C1-INH-HAE type I (43.7%) and type II (51.6%). Patients with family members diagnosed as having C1-INH-HAE were significantly less likely to be misdiagnosed than patients without a family history (140 of 366 [41.7%] vs 38 of 58 [65.5%], respectively; P = .001). Patients with a prior misdiagnosis had longer median delay to C1-INH-HAE diagnosis (13.3 years) than patients without (1.7 years; P < .001). From this large database, approximately 50% of patients with C1-INH-HAE type I or II have previously had their conditions misdiagnosed, most commonly as allergic angioedema or appendicitis. Misdiagnosis results in marked delays in receiving the correct diagnosis, during which time patients cannot access effective, lifesaving treatment.

Age, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) mutation, RTT Severity Scale (RSSS) score, breathing abnormalities, seizure frequency, medications, and ECG parameters were collected. Prolonged QTc was defined as greater than or equal to 460ms. Comparisons at baseline and during follow-up were made. In total, 129 unique patients (all female) had 349 ECGs. At baseline, 12 (9.3%) had a prolonged QTc (median 474ms, interquartile range 470-486ms) and were more likely to have moderate/severe breathing abnormalities (66.7% vs 24.8%; p=0.005) and take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (41.7% vs 15.4%; p=0.04). There was no difference in age, RSSS score, seizures, or mutation. Twenty-six developed prolonged QTc during a median follow-up of 1 year 7 months (interquartile range 0-3y 6mo).

C1-INH-HAE is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to delays in diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and unnecessary procedures. To evaluate the history of misdiagnosis in patients participating in the Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS). The IOS is an observational study in which safety and effectiveness of icatibant have been evaluated since 2009. As part of the IOS, patients record any misdiagnoses received before being diagnosed as having C1-INH-HAE. In January 2016, a total of 418 of 633 IOS patients with C1-INH-HAE type I or II had provided misdiagnosis data. Of these, 185 of 418 (44.3%) received 1 or more prior misdiagnoses. The most common misdiagnoses were allergic angioedema (103 of 185) and appendicitis (50 of 185). A variety of other misdiagnoses were reported, including a substantial number of gastrointestinal disorders (excluding appendicitis). Misdiagnosis rates were similar between males (41.1%) and females (46.5%) and between C1-INH-HAE type I (43.7%) and type II (51.6%). Patients with family members diagnosed as having C1-INH-HAE were significantly less likely to be misdiagnosed than patients without a family history (140 of 366 [41.7%] vs 38 of 58 [65.5%], respectively; P = .001). Patients with a prior misdiagnosis had longer median delay to C1-INH-HAE diagnosis (13.3 years) than patients without (1.7 years; P < .001). From this large database, approximately 50% of patients with C1-INH-HAE type I or II have previously had their conditions misdiagnosed, most commonly as allergic angioedema or appendicitis. Misdiagnosis results in marked delays in receiving the correct diagnosis, during which time patients cannot access effective, lifesaving treatment.

However, the association between the use of inhalers and the development of haemoptysis has rarely been explored. The objective of this study was to assess the association between the risk of haemoptysis and the use of inhalers in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. A nested case-control study was performed using a national claims database from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011. Inhalers including inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β2 agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), short-acting β2 agonists (SABA), short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) and their combinations were tested for the risk of clinically significant haemoptysis events. Among the 62 530 eligible new users of inhalers with non-CF bronchiectasis, 6180 patients with haemoptysis and 27 486 strictly matched controls were selected. In the unadjusted analyses, SAMA, LAMA, SABA and ICS/LABA significantly increased the risk of haemoptysis. After adjustment for other inhaled respiratory medications, comorbidities, health-care utilization and concomitant medications, SAMA, SABA and LAMA consistently increased the risk of haemoptysis (SAMA: odds ratio (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.4; LAMA: OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2; SABA: OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2). The association between anticholinergics (SAMA and LAMA) and risk of haemoptysis showed a dose-dependent trend (P for trend, <0.001). The use of SABA and inhaled anticholinergics in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis increased the risk of haemoptysis. The risk-benefit ratio of inhaled bronchodilators should be considered in the haemoptysis-susceptible population.']}': Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': \"This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens, however you requested 4117 tokens (3117 in your prompt; 1000 for the completion).

It comprises an overview and three papers, all published or submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. Non-infectious dyspnoea, chronic cough and wheezing are common symptoms in the population. Patients often present with these symptoms in general practice and have a high probability of having obstructive lung diseases. However, there is an indication that the majority of these patients are treated empirically with pharmacotherapy targeting obstructive lung disease and only few have additional tests conducted, although the predictive value of respiratory symptoms for diagnosing obstructive lung disease has proven to be low. Spirometry is recommended as the gold standard for confirming obstructive lung disease, and testing can also rule out airway obstruction in patients with respiratory symptoms caused by other illnesses, such as heart failure or lung cancer. Initiating medication for obstructive lung disease without spirometry entails the risk of these patients experiencing unnecessary delay in the diagnostic process and being exposed to unnecessary economic costs and medication risks. The literature has indicated that many users of medication targeting obstructive lung medication have not had spirometry performed and do not actually have obstructive lung disease. This potential quality gap needs to be assessed. Also, in order to target interventions enhancing earlier spirometry utilisation among patients initiating medication targeting obstructive lung disease, improved knowledge on patient and practice factors associated with spirometry testing is needed. Among first time users of obstructive lung medication we aimed: - To assess to what extent spirometry was performed within the first year of medication use (Study I) - To assess if patient characteristics like socioeconomic and demographic status were associated with spirometry testing (Studies I &II) - To assess if general practice characteristics were associated with spirometry testing (Study III) Register-based observational studies on first time users of medication targeting obstructive lung disease among adults over 18 years of age in 2008.

All spirometry tests provided to the patient cohort in the time period 2007-2010 were extracted from the Danish National Health Service Register and the Danish National Patient Register and we assessed if patients had a spirometry registered in an 18- month time period counting from 6 months before to 12 months after their first redemption of medication. We linked socioeconomic and demographic patient variables and variables on practice characteristics from National registers to assess their association with patients having spirometry performed. A total of 40,969 adults initiated medication targeting obstructive lung medication in 2008 in Denmark. The mean age of the cohort was 55.6 years (SD18.7) and approximately half of the mediations users had spirometry test performed.

After adjustment for other inhaled respiratory medications, comorbidities, health-care utilization and concomitant medications, SAMA, SABA and LAMA consistently increased the risk of haemoptysis (SAMA: odds ratio (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.4; LAMA: OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2; SABA: OR, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2). The association between anticholinergics (SAMA and LAMA) and risk of haemoptysis showed a dose-dependent trend (P for trend, <0.001). The use of SABA and inhaled anticholinergics in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis increased the risk of haemoptysis. The risk-benefit ratio of inhaled bronchodilators should be considered in the haemoptysis-susceptible population.', 'Evaluation of disease-specific health-related quality of life in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a debilitating and life-threatening disease despite improvements in hemodynamics, exercise capacity and survival with recent therapeutic advances. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has, therefore, been proposed as an important outcome for evaluating care. Relatively little, however, is known regarding HRQOL or its determinants in PAH. The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire was recently adapted and validated for HRQOL measurement in PAH. We applied this pulmonary hypertension-specific version (MLHF-PH) to a larger population of PAH patients. Ninety-three consecutive outpatients with PAH completed the MLHF-PH. Scores were assessed for correlations with demographics, symptoms, hemodynamics and treatments. Patients with PAH had significantly impaired HRQOL as assessed by the disease-specific MLHF-PH. Each physical and emotional component, as well as total scores on the MLHF-PH indicated severely depressed HRQOL. As compared to other diagnoses, PAH associated with scleroderma had the worst HRQOL. Patients with WHO functional Class II symptoms reported better HRQOL than Class III patients. Fatigue, weakness and abdominal discomfort were each associated with more severely depressed HRQOL, as was current epoprostenol use. With the sole exception of the right atrial pressure, hemodynamic measurements did not correlate with HRQOL scores. Simultaneous evaluation of HRQOL with a non-disease-specific questionnaire (SF-36) revealed a similarly impaired status, although identified fewer associations with patient-specific factors. Severely impaired HRQOL is present in this population of patients with PAH evaluated with a disease-specific questionnaire. The availability of a pulmonary hypertension-specific HRQOL questionnaire may enable further targeted investigations of factors that might improve outcomes.']}': Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': \"This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens, however you requested 4107 tokens (3107 in your prompt; 1000 for the completion).

The first step in managing asthma is to identify and avoid triggers, such as allergens, smoke, and exercise. This can help prevent asthma attacks and reduce the need for medication. In addition, using a peak flow meter to monitor lung function can help identify early signs of an asthma attack and allow for prompt treatment. Medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, are also important in managing asthma. These medications help reduce inflammation and open up the airways, making it easier to breathe. It is important for individuals with asthma to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan and regularly review and adjust medications as needed. In addition, quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also help improve asthma control. By following these strategies, individuals can effectively manage their asthma and improve their overall quality of life.',\n",

The study enrolled a total of 3,000 subjects, 1,500 in each study arm, and follow-up was conducted at 45 days post-MI. The results of the trial showed that medication 1 had a significantly lower number of deaths from cardiac causes compared to medication 2, with a p-value of 0.03.
